At Naked, we believe it’s the little healthy choices that make a difference – this is why we put goodness inside our products and bring goodness outside to the world.
Through our sustainable packaging, ingredient sourcing and community support, we bring the Goodness Outside to life.

RENEWABOTTLE
Recycle. ReUse. Reincarnate. Reduce
Do you believe in bottle reincarnation? We do. Naked® reNEWabottle® is made from other recycled bottles, and can be turned into another bottle once you’re done with it. Since
we’re the first nationally distributed juice company to use 100% rPET(recyclable polyethylene terephthalate), we need your help returning them to be sure they’re turned into bottles again. This saves about 25% more energy than if we started with virgin plastic.
+rPET recycled plastic is a finite resource. However, it becomes more abundant when consumers recycle more plastic. By recycling all Naked products we can continue the cycle.
