Mother Nature gave us some pretty great stuff to play with-so we would never cover up the taste of her delicious bounty with artificial flavors or added sugars. So every time you crave delicious fruits and veggies, you can be 100% sure that every Naked juice smoothie is providing you with just that.
“OUR STORY” IS AS NAKED AS THE DAY WE WERE BORN
In 1983, we started slinging our home made juice blends and smoothies to Santa Monica sunbathers from an ice-filled backpack up and down the California coast. While you can now find our blends from coast to coast, we remain true to our original purpose: To help people get more out of life. We do this by simply doing what we do best: Blending the best fruits and veggies Mother Nature has to offer into the tastiest, juices we can imagine. And we do our best to do this in the most sustainable ways possible.
